# HandGestureRecognition
This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition system to assist patients with Motor Neuron Disease (MND). The system uses OpenCV, MediaPipe and Deep Neural Network to recognize and interpret hand gestures, providing a means for MND patients to communicate more effectively.
